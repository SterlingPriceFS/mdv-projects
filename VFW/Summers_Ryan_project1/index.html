		    You may not have known it, but the everyday life you lead is not the boring existence it may seem at first glance. The daily tasks you complete are actually <span>Quests</span>. Completing your <span>Quests</span> actually requires you use your <span>Skills</span>, and they progress the more you use them. You aren't just walking through each day of a mundane existence; you are actually at the beginning point of your epic journey. Enter your daily <span>Quests</span> with as much or as little detail as you like. Let's add your first <span>Quest</span> now.
