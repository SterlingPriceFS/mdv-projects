		    WELCOME! My name is Scribe, and I'll be your enchanted Quest Log for this journey. You may not have known it, but the everyday life you lead is not the boring existence it may seem at first glance. The daily tasks you complete are actually Quests. Completing your Quests actually requires you use your Skills, and they progress the more you use them. You aren't just walking through each day of a mundane existence. You are actually at the beginning point of your epic journey, and if you ever hope to survive  challenges on the way, vanquish the villains that await you, and protect the plots of the land that create your kingdom, you have to do what every epic hero or heroine does...
		    </p>
		    <h3>LEVEL UP!</h3>
		    <p>
		    Enter your daily Quests (tasks) with as much or as little detail as you like, your enchanted Quest log will fill in the details you can't.  keep track of your progress. Periodically you'll be presented challenges to test your progress and provide with you rewards. I'll track all of your Quest results and keep you posted on your progress. Let's add your first Quest now.
